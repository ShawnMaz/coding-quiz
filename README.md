# Coding Quiz

## Description
Coding Quiz is a Single Page Application written in plain JavaScript to demonstrate my abilities of manipulating the DOM elements using JavaScript.

Users can see if they got the previous questions right or wrong at the bottom of the page. After the quiz is complete or if the time runs out, then the user is presented with a page where they can submit there scores. All the scores are saved in the browser's local storage. After submitting the score the user is able to view a list of top 10 high scores.
